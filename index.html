    Virtural Tracing
</header>

<body>
    Geolocation in general refers to the identification of the real geographical area of
an electronic device, such as a cell phone, IP addresses, WiFi, and MAC addresses.
Now that being said that does not mean an IP address can be traced directly to a
house. Geolocation particularly for IP addresses is not an exact science. Unlike cell
phones that can be traced via their GPS coordinates or cell tower triangulation, IP
addresses use a common database of address locations maintained by different companies.
